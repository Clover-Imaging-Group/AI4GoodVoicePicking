# Build and Test
We will be implementation GitHub Actions for CI/CD for this project. We would suggest that folks fork the project and setup their own actions to push into their Azure tenant.
TODO: Create Wiki entry on process and configuration of GitHub Actions

# Contribute
As this is our first open-sourced project we're working on how best people can contribute. For the moment we'd suggest fork, change, test, and do a pull request. Remember testing is a bit different with a voice system! You'll want to talk to it.
